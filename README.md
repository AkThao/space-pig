# Space Pig:  A game made with Pygame Zero

## Objective
The aim of the game is simple â€“ avoid the falling space debris.

## Technology
This game is written is Python 3, using Pygame Zero, a wrapper around Pygame, which itself is a wrapper around SDL (used for 2D window creation and to provide hardware support). I used Vectornator to design the graphics.
